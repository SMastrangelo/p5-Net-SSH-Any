PARAMETERS:
-profile=file
  Load connect parameters from the specified Bitvise SSH Client profile. Server host, port, SPN, SSPI, username, initial authentication method, algorithms, keep alive and re-exchange settings are loaded. If a command line parameter is additionally specified for any of these, it overrides the corresponding profile setting.
-host=host
  The server host to connect to overriding the already set host.
-port=port
  The port on server host to connect to overriding the already set port.
-spn=SPN
  If specified, Bitvise SSH Client will use the value of this parameter as the service principal name during Kerberos authentication. If not specified, Bitvise SSH Client will use a default, but possibly incorrect, SPN based on the SSH server's host name.
-sspi=y|n
  SSPI/Kerberos 5 host authentication - disabled by default, but can also be disabled explicitly to override profile setting.
-sspiDlg=y|n
  Permit access delegation - disabled by default, but can also be disabled explicitly to override profile setting. For use only with SSPI/Kerberos 5 host authentication.
-user=username
  The username to login with overriding the already set username.
-gka
  Log in using the gssapi-keyex method. Available only when SSPI/Kerberos 5 host authentication has been performed. Can also be combined with other authentication methods, in which case gssapi-keyex is attempted first.
-gma
  Log in using the gssapi-with-mic method. Can also be combined with other authentication methods, in which case gssapi-with-mic is attempted after gssapi-keyex.
-krb
  Use gssapi-with-mic with the Kerberos 5 mechanism only.
-ntlm
  Use gssapi-with-mic with the NTLM mechanism only.
-gmaDlg
  Permit access delegation - disabled by default. For use only with gssapi-with-mic user authentication.
-pk=slot
  Log in using the publickey method, with the keypair in the specified slot. Can also be combined with other authentication methods, in which case publickey is attempted after gssapi-with-mic.
-pp=passphrase
  A passphrase for the keypair specified with -pk.
-pw=password
  Log in with the specified password. Can also be combined with other authentication methods, in which case the password is attempted after the publickey method.
-kbdi
  Log in with the keyboard-interactive method. Can also be combined with other authentication methods, in which case the keyboard-interactive method is attempted last.
-sub=submethods
  Optional submethods for keyboard-interactive.
-unat=y|n
  Use unattended mode to prevent any user interaction by the SSH session - in particular, host key verification and user authentication. Disabled by default.
-trustLsp=y|n
  If enabled, only a narrow selection of trusted Windows Sockets LSP providers will be used, promoting stability, but at a possible expense of connectivity. If disabled, any LSP that is installed will be used, promoting connectivity, but at a possible expense of stability. By default, only trusted LSPs are used.
-encr=list
  Comma-separated priority list of session encryption algorithms. If not specified, the following algorithm list is assumed: aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr,3des-ctr,aes256-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc.
-mac=list
  Comma-separated priority list of session MAC algorithms. If not specified, the following algorithm list is assumed: hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha1.
-cmpr=list
  Comma-separated priority list of session compression algorithms. If not specified, the following algorithm list is assumed: none,zlib.
-kex=list
  Comma-separated priority list of ECDH and DH key exchange algorithms. If not specified, the following algorithm list is assumed: ecdh-sha2/secp256k1,ecdh-sha2/nistp521,ecdh-sha2/nistp384,ecdh-sha2/nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, plus any GSSAPI key exchange methods if -sspi was specified. When connecting to OpenSSH servers, the diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 and diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 algorithms will automatically be moved to the back of the list for compatibility reasons.
-hkey=list
  Comma-separated priority list of host key algorithms. If not specified, the following algorithm list is assumed: ECDSA/secp256k1,ECDSA/nistp521,ECDSA/nistp384,ECDSA/nistp256,RSA,DSA.
-ka
  Keep-alive / broken session detection - enabled by default, but can also be enabled explicitly to override profile.
-kre
  Key re-exchange - enabled by default, but can also be enabled explicitly to override profile.
-noRegistry
  Do not load settings from or store them to Windows registry. Use of global client proxy settings, host key database, and user keypair database is prevented.
-baseRegistry=registry-key
  A base Windows registry key to replace the default 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Bitvise' key.
-proxy=y|n
  Use a proxy server, overrides global client proxy settings.
-proxyType=type
  The type of proxy server to use. 'SOCKS4', 'SOCK5', and 'HTTP' proxy types are supported. 'SOCKS4' is set by default.
-proxyServer=server
  The IP address or DNS name of the proxy server.
-proxyPort=port
  The proxy server port, 1080 by default.
-proxyUsername=username
  The proxy server username (SOCKS5 and HTTP only).
-proxyPassword=password
  The proxy server password (SOCKS5 and HTTP only).
-proxyResolveLocally=y|n
  Resolve a DNS name locally before passing it to the proxy when this flag is used.
-hostKeyMD5=MD5-fingerprint
  A CSV list of MD5 fingerprints of host keys to accept, used additionally to global client host key database
-hostKeyBB=Bubble-Babble
  A CSV lost of Bubble-Babble of host keys to accept, used additionally to global client host key database
-hostKeyFile=file
  A file containing host keys to accept, used additionally to global client host key database
-keypairFile=file
  A file containing a private key for authentication; overrides keys in global client user keypair database.
-keypairPassphrase=passphrase
  Provide a passphrase for the keypair specified with the -keypairFile parameter. Passphrase must always be present when an OpenSSH encoded and passphrase protected keypair is specified.
-traceLog
  Enable trace logging.
-flowDebugFile=file
  Enable Flow debbuging to the specified textual file.
-title=title
  Use this parameter to set a custom console window title.
-x11=y|n

-x11Dsp=display
  The X11 display associated with X11 forwarding. Set to 127.0.0.1:0.0 by default.
-x11MMC1=mitMagicCookie1

-shell
  Execute the program configured at the server as the shell. This is the default choice when no command is specified.
-cmd=command
  Execute the specified command. Alternativelly, a command can be passed without being -cmd prefixed. In that case, however, note that any parameters beyond the command are treated as part of the command itself.

EXAMPLES:
sexec myserver -cmd="cmd /c dir"
  Logs into 'myserver' with the account name of the current Windows user as the username. Will prompt to choose an authentication method when connected.Will execute 'cmd /c dir'.
sexec someuser@myserver -cmd="ls -la"
  Logs into 'myserver' as 'someuser'; will prompt to choose an authentication method when connected and execute 'ls -la'.
sexec someuser@myserver:9222 -cmd=df
  Logs into 'myserver' on port 9222 as 'someuser', executing 'df'.
sexec myusername@myserver -pw=mypassword -shell
  Logs into 'myserver' as 'myusername' with password 'mypassword', executing whatever program is configured at the server as the shell.
sexec myusername@myserver -pk=1 -cmd="cmd /c cd \temp & rd subdir"
  Uses the public key in slot 1 for user authentication instead of a plain password, then executing 'cd \temp' followed by 'rd subdir'.
